# SEPT Startup code and  project Structure documentation 

# Quick Start
CircleCI implemented for back/frontend deployment to aws.
However this is unable to be tested due to lack of CircleCI credits.

BackEnd : 
In BackEnd/agme
Simply run the AgmeApplication.java main and the BackEnd should be up and running on port 8080.
Alternatively: run docker-compose file to start a docker container

` http://localhost:8080/h2-console `

Can be used to access the database in order to check the contents.

FrontEnd :
Navigate to the directory ` majorproject-7-tues-14-30-3/FrontEnd/agme_react/my-app ` and then run the command;

`npm start` 

Is required to run React on port 3000. The site can be reached via 

`http://localhost:3000/Dashboard`,  

but you would be automatically redirected to the site after running `npm start`

You need to make sure that the correct dependencies are installed as well. The extra dependencies which you need, separate from what you get from `npm install` are,

Axios, redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, redux-devtools-extension, prop-types.

These can also be installed by running the commands

` npm i axios `
` npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk`
` redux-devtools-extension`
` npm install --save prop-types`

You can test the functionality by signing up as either a worker or a customer and logging in and checking the options available to you in your DashBoard. Advice to create at least one customer and one worker or you wonâ€™t be able to properly test the booking functionality as you need one of each in order to book.

Signup to create accounts, login as a valid customer or worker account, customers can create new bookings and view their past and upcoming bookings. Workers can only view their past and upcoming bookings.
