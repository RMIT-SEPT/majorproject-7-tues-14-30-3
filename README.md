## Code documentation

[Quick Start](/docs/README.md) in `docs` folder


CircleCI implementation, including relavent docker files has been included for this release. 
CircleCI successfully builds and and deployes to aws (see screen shots). 
However this is not testable in this repo it does not have circleCI credits.
All circleCI work has been done on a cloned repo as a work around.
An aws cluster, service and task definition has been created, along with repos for front and back end images.(See screen shots)
However it is not yet live as piping between images is still being developed.
